## SwiftUI - iOS App Switcher

This project is an approximation of the iOS app switcher UI experience, built with SwiftUI.

The following interactions are supported:

* Initial blurred state exposing part of the app switcher along the leading edge of the screen, with
  continued dragging revealing app views in a side by side layout, scaling in size as the height of
  the drag changes.
* Overlapping layout with horizontal panning shifting views from the left to the right in an
  accelerated fashion.

To view, open the project in Xcode 12+ and build/run or preview HomeScreen.swift, tap & drag up from the
dock. Enjoy.
